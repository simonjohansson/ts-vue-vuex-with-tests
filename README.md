# This is for me.

Yay, I finally got TS + Vue + Vuex + unit tests + broswer tests to work properly.

This is just a playground to experiment with Vue(x) + TypeScript.

## Project setup
```
yarn install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development

```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn run lint
```

yarn run test:unit
```

### Run your end-to-end tests

yarn run test:e2e
```
